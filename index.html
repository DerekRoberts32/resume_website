										<h2>Derek's Resume Website</h2>
										<p> About </a> </p>
									</header>
									<p> Welcome to my resume website! My name is Derek Roberts. I'm a student majoring in Computer Science at Boston University. I first became interested in coding when I took Computer Science my senior year of high school. In this class we programmed in scratch and learned the fundamentals of Python. We also coded in HTML where I learned some of the very skills I used to make this website! Computer science was the first class that truly captivated me. I became obsessed with learning more, driven by my love for problem solving. I can finally say I found my passion and I hope to use my skills to improve the world around me. </p>

											<br>
											<br>
											<p><b>Objective:</b> I wanted to work on a full-stack project involving the MERN stack. I followed a guide on how to clone zoom, and taught myself about the required libraries.</p>
											<p><b>Tech Stack:</b> NodeJS, JavaScript
												<br>
												 I wanted to use NodeJS to build a full stack application. I build a Zoom clone with audio and visual connectives capabilities using Peer-to-Peer and Socket.io.</p>

											<h4>AI Connect Four</h4>
											<a href="https://github.com/robertsderek/connectFour">Github Link</a>

											<br>
											<br>
											<p><b>Objective:</b> I wanted to create a solo project at HackHarvard 2022 in the Entertainment track. I wanted to familiarize myself with the pygame library, as well as a bit of AI, and combine those with my Python experience.</p>
											<p><b>Tech Stack:</b> Python (classroom), pygame library (self taught) 
												<br>
												 I wanted to submit a project in the Entertainment track at HackHarvard 2022. I was working solo and had been interested in the pygame library, so I taught myself enough to make a game of Connect Four. I didn't want a game that was exclusively for two players, so I created an AI program that could look ahead a certain number of moves depending on the difficulty.</p>

											<a href="https://github.com/robertsderek/resume" class="image"><img src="images/resume.png" alt="" /></a>
											<br>
											<br>
											<p><b>Objective:</b> I wanted to create a website to adequately showcase my projects and experience with Computer Science.</p>
											<p><b>Tech Stack:</b> HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (all self taught) 
												<br>
												I chose these languages because I wanted to be familiar with the most popular Front-End languages. I started with a format from html5up.net and built upon it. GitHub Pages allows me to host a website for free, which I took advantage of here.</p>
